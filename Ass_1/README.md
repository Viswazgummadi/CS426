# Blockchain Assignment 1

This project implements a basic blockchain system with support for sequential and multi-threaded block mining. It provides a way to manage and visualize a blockchain, as well as adding blocks using two different methods:

1. **Sequential Block Addition** (Part 1)
2. **Multi-threaded Block Mining** (Part 2)

## Prerequisites

- **g++** (C++ compiler)
- **make** (Build automation tool)
- **OpenSSL** (For cryptographic functions)

Ensure you have these dependencies installed before proceeding.

## How to Build and Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

cd CS426/Ass_1
```
### prerequisites
```sh
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```
### 2. Build
```sh
make all
```
## 2.1 Build Sequential block addition
```sh
make part1
```
## 2.2 Build Multi-threaded block mining
```sh
make part2
```
### 3 Run
```sh
